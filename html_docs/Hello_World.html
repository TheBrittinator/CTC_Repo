      <p>Purple finch songs are described as being musical warbles and during flight they make a √¢‚Ç¨≈ìtick√¢‚Ç¨¬ù sound. Male purple finches may hop as high as a foot in the air while puffing out their chest and cocking their tails in order to attract a mate. Purple finches are primarily seed eaters, but they will also eat insects and fruits. They have a particular passion for berries in winter. You can also offer them peanut pieces and mealworms.

        <p> Cardigan Mountain State Park is a local favorite, providing magnificent views from its network of trails to and along the ridge. A seasonal dirt road brings you to a parking area with picnic tables and a small pavilion. There is no potable water or campground, and the park is known mainly for its hiking trails. There√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s no required fee to recreate here; however, there is a box for donations to help maintain state park property and trails. The 1.5-mile-long West Ridge Trail leaves from the parking area and is the most direct route to the top with 1,200 feet of elevation gain. An alternate, longer trail to the summit is the South Ridge Trail, which splits off from the West Ridge Trail a half-mile from the trailhead. Hikers looking for a steep approach can consider the Holt Trail.

        <p> The purple lilac, Syringa vulgaris, is the state flower of New Hampshire. New Hampshire historian Leon Anderson writes in To This Day that the purple lilac was first imported from England and planted at the Portsmouth home of Governor Benning Wentworth in 1750. It was adopted as our state's flower in 1919.
