          <h3> State Bird: Purple Finch </h3>
          <p>Purple finch songs are described as being musical warbles and during <br>
            flight they make a distinct tick sound. Male purple finches may <br>
            hop as high as a foot in the air while puffing out their chest and cocking <br>
             their tails in order to attract a mate. Purple finches are primarily seed <br>
             eaters, but they will also eat insects and fruits. They have a particular <br>
             passion for berries in winter. You can also offer them peanut pieces and <br>
             mealworms.

          <h4> Cardigan Mountain State Park </h4>
          <p> Cardigan Mountain State Park is a local favorite, providing <br>
                magnificent views from its network of trails to and along the ridge. <br>
                 A seasonal dirt road brings you to a parking area with picnic tables and a <br>
                 small pavilion. There is no potable water or campground, and the park is <br>
                 known mainly for its hiking trails. There is no required fee to <br>
                 recreate here; however, there is a box for donations to help maintain state <br>
                 park property and trails. The 1.5-mile-long West Ridge Trail leaves from the <br>
                  parking area and is the most direct route to the top with 1,200 feet of <br>
                  elevation gain. An alternate, longer trail to the summit is the South Ridge <br>
                   Trail, which splits off from the West Ridge Trail a half-mile from the <br>
                   trailhead. Hikers looking for a steep approach can consider the Holt Trail. <br>

              <h5> State Flower: Purple Lilac </h5>
              <p> The purple lilac, Syringa vulgaris, is the state flower of New Hampshire. <br>
                 New Hampshire historian Leon Anderson writes in To This Day that the purple <br>
                  lilac was first imported from England and planted at the Portsmouth home <br>
                  of Governor Benning Wentworth in 1750. It was adopted as our state's flower <br>
                   in 1919.
