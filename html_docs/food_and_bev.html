        <p>
            Granite mountains and clear lakes can be found in New Hampshire. It is a popular tourist destination because of its everyday beauty and the abundance of famous dishes found there. Restaurants across the state have access to nearby supplies of fresh vegetables because of the abundance of farms and apple orchards on the state's rolling hills. There is also lots of fresh seafood even just a short distance from the coast. If you want it fried, New Hampshire has got you covered.

        <p>
            Not to be missed is the recently developed Hampshire fish shack scene. Rows of picnic tables are typically seen in a large area with people elbow-deep in lobster shells, steamers, melted butter, and the occasional vinaigrette fry.

        <h2>Apple Cider Cocktails</h2>

            There are numerous apple orchards in New Hampshire. Cider is a regional favorite in addition to raw apples. A few house cocktails are made in the White Mountain Cider Company restaurant in Bartlett.
