# Note to Collaborators:
- learning github version control is SUPER useful. A lot of your projects are shareable from here, and it's great for setting up a portfolio. I have one on my page if you would like to check it out. The link to my portfolio site is here :  [My Portfolio](https://thebrittinator.github.io/Britt-s_portfolio/)

### You can launch a Jekyl website for your portfolio with Github too! Good practice to get familiar with the site.
- A youtube video that can help you get introduced to collaborating with Github repositories is here [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nyIS58ORWw)
- I can upload more videos that have helped me setup my repo if you want, just let me know.
